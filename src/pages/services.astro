        <h2 class={cn(h2)}>Selecting Colors with Real Deal Painting</h2>
        <p class={cn(p)}>
          When it comes to exterior painting, it's vital to take into account
          the established colors of your home, such as brick, stonework, and
          roofing. The ideal color schemes are those that complement these
          existing features.
        </p>
        <p class={cn(p)}>
          Consider embracing a shade that enhances the color of an unpainted
          section - like highlighting the brown in your brick or a shade of
          green from your stonework.
        </p>
        <p class={cn(p)}>
          It's also essential to remember that your home is part of a community;
          its aesthetic is influenced by neighboring homes and the surrounding
          landscape. While you may not want your house to be the exact color as
          your neighbor's, selecting a shade that harmonizes with nearby homes
          can be beneficial.
        </p>
        <p class={cn(p)}>
          Additionally, be mindful that certain colors are more suited to
          specific environments. For instance, earth tones are typically a great
          choice for natural, wooded areas.
        </p>
        <h2 class={cn(h2)}>Quality Paint Options with Real Deal Painting</h2>
        <p class={cn(p)}>
          The external factors such as extreme temperatures, humidity, and
          continuous sun exposure can deteriorate the exterior paint of our
          homes. When paint breaks down, it can expose cracks which allow
          damaging moisture to enter the home. Quality paint can protect against
          severe weather while allowing damaging moisture to escape.
        </p>
        <p class={cn(p)}>
          Nowadays, there are numerous options for weather-resistant paints.
        </p>
        <p class={cn(p)}>
          Elastomeric coatings are gaining popularity; these coatings maintain
          their elasticity across a broad temperature range, making them ideal
          for homes in areas with extreme weather conditions.
        </p>
        <h2 class={cn(h2)}>Real Deal Paintingâ€™s Exterior Painting Process</h2>
        <h3 class={cn(h3)}>Surface Preparation</h3>
        <p class={cn(p)}>
          Proper surface preparation is fundamental to any painting project.
          Various methods can be employed, and it's crucial to determine what
          preparation is needed to achieve the desired results. Some preparation
          techniques are designed for long-lasting results, while others are
          aimed at enhancing the appearance.
        </p>
        <h3 class={cn(h3)}>Pressure Washing</h3>
        <p class={cn(p)}>
          The first step in ensuring a high-quality finish is a clean surface.
          If there is any mold, we will hand wash the area with an appropriate
          cleaning solution. Pressure washing the exterior removes mold, dirt,
          and old paint, providing a solid base for the new paint to adhere to.
        </p>
        <p class={cn(p)}>
          Pressure washing can also be used to clean exterior driveways,
          sidewalks, and stone walls by removing grease, dirt, and moss. As
          pressure washers are powerful machines, only trained professionals
          will handle this equipment.
        </p>
        <h3 class={cn(h3)}>Use of Drop Cloths</h3>
        <p class={cn(p)}>
          Real Deal Painting uses heavy-duty canvas drop cloths. We place them
          around the home where scraping will occur. This practice protects your
          plants, pavement, and soil, and enables easier cleanup at the end of
          the day. The result is a spotless environment once the job is
          complete.
        </p>
        <h3 class={cn(h3)}>Caulking</h3>
        <p class={cn(p)}>
          Caulking is a pliable sealant used in gaps where expansion and
          contraction are expected, such as around windows and doors. It
          prevents moisture from entering the wood, which is often the cause of
          paint failure around these areas.
        </p>
        <p class={cn(p)}>
          Only paintable latex caulking is used on your home. Silicone caulking
          is not paintable and must be removed and replaced before painting as
          it is typically used for bathrooms.
