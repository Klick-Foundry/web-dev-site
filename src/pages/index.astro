      text="They gave us an estimate that was 30% less than the 2 other companies we got quotes from, and they were able to start work right away. The crew was very friendly, professional, and hard-working. They finished the job in one day! It looks fantastic! We are very happy with the work they did."

      text="I called Coppertop Construction to fix my leaking roof, and they were able to come out that same day, within 2 hours of me calling for an estimate! The crew that came was very friendly and polite. They finished the job in 1 day and did a great job cleaning up after themselves. This company is very reliable, and I would highly recommend them!"
